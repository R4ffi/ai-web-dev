# Tool #1 - PlayCode Javascript Playground

PlayCode is a versatile online coding platform for web developers. It's ideal for creating, testing, and sharing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. Whether you're prototyping, learning, or collaborating on web projects, PlayCode streamlines the development process with its interactive coding environment.

In the project you have three files. Each of the files is written in its own language and serves a specific purpose, which is explained in the table below.

| File        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| index.html: | The index file is the main document of your web page. It defines the webpage's structure, using HTML tags for text, images, and links. It establishes the basic content and layout and may reference external CSS and JavaScript files.       |
| script.js:  | The JavaScript file, often named "script.js," contains the code for interactive functionality on the webpage. This can include animations, form validation, backend requests, and more. It enables dynamic behavior and controls the webpage. |
| style.css:  | The CSS file ("style.css") is responsible for the design and styling of the webpage. It sets colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. CSS provides the webpage with its visual appearance and ensures a pleasing user experience.                  |

# Tool #2 - ChatGPT

It provides code examples, assists with troubleshooting errors, and empowers beginners to build websites with confidence, reducing the learning curve for those with limited experience in these technologies.

## How to use ChatGPT for your website

Before you ask ChatGPT for help, it is useful if you already have a clear picture of the final result in your mind. The more detailed you describe it, the better ChatGPT's answers will be.
